TowTruck - Who you call when you get stuck
===========================================

What is TowTruck?
-----------------

TowTruck is a service for your website that makes it surprisingly easy to collaborate in real-time. 

Using TowTruck two people can interact on the same page, seeing each other's cursors, edits, and browsing a site together.  The TowTruck service is included by the web site owner, and a web site can customize and configure aspects of TowTruck's behavior on the site.

Using TowTruck On Your Site
---------------------------

To use our hosted version of towtruck you should add the `towtruck.js` file to your website:

```html
<script src="https://towtruck.mozillalabs.com/towtruck.js"></script>
```

Then you can call `TowTruck()` to start TowTruck, or include this HTML to have TowTruck insert a *Start TowTruck* button:

```html
<div id="towtruck-starter"></div>
```

That's it!  TowTruck works pretty well without any customization at all.

Configuring TowTruck
--------------------

There are a few configurable parameters for TowTruck.  To configure these you have three options:

```javascript
// If you have your configuration after <script src="towtruck.js"> loaded:
TowTruck.config({configName: value});

// If you aren't sure if towtruck.js is loaded:
TowTruckConfig = {configName: value};

// And if you want to be even more vague about the order in which configuration
// has to be defined:
TowTruckConfig_configName = value;
```

There are a couple configuration parameters:

* `hubBase`: this is the location of the [WebSocket hub server](https://github.com/mozilla/towtruck/blob/master/app/hub/server.js).  It defaults to `https://hub.towtruck.mozillalabs.com` which is an open usable hub.  If you want to host your own hub you'd change this.

* `cloneClicks`: this is a jQuery selector (string) of all the elements whose clicks you'd like to automatically clone across clients.  That means that if you give something like `"#submit"` then if one person clicks on `<input type="submit" id="submit">` that button will be clicked on all clients.  This is experimental, and is actually quite likely to be removed (see issue [#75](https://github.com/mozilla/towtruck/issues/75) and [#160](https://github.com/mozilla/towtruck/issues/160)).

Setup/Development
-----------------

TowTruck has two main pieces:

* The [server](https://github.com/mozilla/towtruck/blob/master/app/http/server.js), which echos messages back and forth between users.  The server is dumb.

* The [client](https://github.com/mozilla/towtruck/tree/master/app/http/public/towtruck), which does all the real work.

There is a TowTruck server deployed at `https://hub.towtruck.mozillalabs.com` - and there's little need for other server deployments.  If you want to try TowTruck out we recommend you use our server, because it's easiest and the server is boring.

The static files do contain some configuration parameters, and so you need to "build" them to make them usable.  TowTruck uses [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), so you need the LESS compiler (`lessc`) installed:

```sh
$ npm install -g less
$ git clone git://github.com/mozilla/towtruck.git
$ cd towtruck
$ ./bin/make-static-client STATIC_FILES http://url.where/you/will/publish
$ scp -r STATIC_FILES/* url.where:/www/public/you/will/publish/
```

Now you have your own static copy of the client, potentially with your own modifications and customizations of the code.

Local Server
------------

If you do want to use the server (which conveniently updates those files on demand, so you don't have to rebuild after edits):

It's recommended that you use Foreman to run your development servers. "Why?", you ask. Here's a great intro: [Introducing Foreman](http://blog.daviddollar.org/2011/05/06/introducing-foreman.html).

Foreman is a [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) project the easiest way to get it running locally is to be using a relatively recent version of Ruby and Gem and execute: `gem install foreman`. You may need administrator access to do this, in which case you should run it with sudo.

### Configuration for Foreman

Copy and edit your .env file. -- This should never be committed to the repo.

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

### Dependencies

Execute `npm install` in the application directory:

### Running in Development mode

```
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

This will start all the servers including the examples server.

Servers
-------

### Hub Server

This exists in app/hub/server.js. By default in dev mode, it serves the setup code here: [http://localhost:8080/towtruck.js](http://localhost:8080/towtruck.js).

- `server.js`: the Node.js server, just one file.  It's pretty dumb, just passing messages back and forth between clients.  It is a goal to keep it dumb, and leave the important logic in the client.  Most of the code you'll see in there is to make development easier, handling the sequential loading of modules, compiling LESS, inserting templates, etc.

Third-party libraries in `app/http/public/towtruck/libs/`.

A basic overview of the code, which is in `app/http/public/towtruck`:


- `channels.js`: abstraction over WebSockets and other communication methods.  Buffers output while the connection is opening, handles JSON encoding/decoding.

- `chat.js`: the chat widget

- `element-finder.js`: when you want to talk about a particular element with another browser/client, this creates a description and finds elements based on that description.  `#id` is the easiest description of course, but this handles elements that lack ids.

- `session.js`: this is where most of the setup work is done. It establishes the channels, routes messages to different components, and handles persistence.

- `towtruck.js`: this is the bootstrap code.  It doesn't do anything, but when asked it knows how to load up all the other modules and get things started.  It also detects if TowTruck should be started immediately (like when someone opens the "share" link).

- `tracker.js`: this handles the tracking/syncing of individual pieces across clients.  The support code for sharing textareas, form controls, and CodeMirror components is in here.

- `util.js`: several bits of abstract support code are in here.  It's also the file that must be loaded first, it sets up jQuery and Underscore as noConflict, creates the TowTruck object.  It also includes a pattern for creating classes, assertions, events.

- `cursor.js`: handles the shared cursors and clicks

- `webrtc.js`: handles the audio and avatar editing

- `cobrowse.js`: handles cases when the users are at different URLs

- `app/http/views/towtruck/*.tmpl`: these are Underscore templates for the UI bits.  These are automatically inlined into `towtruck-runner.js`.



### Examples Server

There are some examples in `app/examples/`. These are served up on `EXAMPLE_SERVER_PORT` which defaults to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

[http://localhost:8081/friendlycode.html](http://localhost:8081/friendlycode.html) is an example of a [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) editor, embedded in [FriendlyCode](https://github.com/mozilla/friendlycode) (which in turn is the basis of [Thimble](https://thimble.webmaker.org/en-US/)).




Integration
-----------

TowTruck is meant to be an unintrusive bit of Javascript you add to your page to enable these collaborative features.  It inspects the page to determine what fields can be synchronized between the two browsers, and adds its own interface on top of the content.

`towtruck.js` itself is just a small piece of code to start up TowTruck, it should not cause overhead in your code.  You can either include an element on your page `<div id="towtruck-starter"></div>`, and a TowTruck button will be added to that, or you can call `TowTruck()` yourself.

You can enter `/help` into the chat window to see some developer-oriented features.

### Docking

In order to enable docking, you must have at least one element in your page with the class `towtruck-undocked`.  When the chat interface is "docked" this class is swapped for `towtruck-docked`.  You can also put `data-towtruck-doc-*` attributes on your body element, which are additional CSS rules applied to the chat window when docked.

You may generally find it sufficient to do:

```css
#container.towtruck-docked {
  margin-right: 420px;
}
```

The idea being that you clear a 420px area on the left side of the screen when the interface is docked.  Of course 420px is a very specific number, and it likely to change, so please test docking if you use it.

Bookmarklet
-----------

Go to `http://localhost:8080/bookmarklet.html` for a bookmarklet that you can use to start TowTruck.  This of course excludes the possibility of the page cooperating with TowTruck, but much of what it does is automatic anyway.

Firefox Add-on
--------------------

There's a Firefox Add-on that enables testing on sites that don't include towtruck.js on their own.

You can downlod the add-on here: https://towtruck.mozillalabs.com/towtruck.xpi

It adds a link into the status bar:

![TowTruck Add-on Link](https://towtruck.mozillalabs.com/images/readme/add-on-link.jpg)

Clicking it enables TowTruck on any site, such as http://github.com/

![TowTruck Enabled on Github](https://towtruck.mozillalabs.com/images/readme/add-on-enabled.jpg)


Testing
-------

There isn't much right now. [Walkabout.js](https://github.com/ianb/walkabout.js) is included in the code, which is a tool to do random things on a page.  The plan is to combine this with lots of santiy checks in the code itself.  You can activate Walkabout with `/test` in the chat (`/help` to see more options).

You can also go to `http://localhost:8080/tests/?name=exercise.js` for some other simple tests.
