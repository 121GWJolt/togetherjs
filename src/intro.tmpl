<% /*
  This is the element shown when you first start up TowTruck, and must share
  the link to invite another person.  Bindings:

  * .towtruck-close closes the page
  * .towtruck-link is where the share link is displayed.  It is
    automatically selected on focus
  * #towtruck-name is updated and automatically saved with the person's name
  * #towtruck-name-waiting is shown (and #towtruck-name-confirmation
    is hidden) when an update is made; the update is immediate but we
    swap these to show that the value is saved without submission.

  This is used in TowTruck.start().  No variables are provided.
